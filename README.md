# Technologies Used:
Node.js, EJS, Express, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Mongoose, MongoDB

# Approaches:
I wanted to create a website that everyone could use to post their own recipes to make the trouble of finding someothing to cook easy and manageable. I wanted to find some way to sort it by the type of cuisine the user was looking for. I also wanted pages where you could look at the recipes that were most recently created and click on an image that looked appealing to bring you to the recipe page and information. I also wanted to be able to edit and delete recipes that the user created. I created all my routes first to make sure they worked. All the starting routes were for my index, show, edit, update, delete, and new routes. I then created the pages using EJS and styled all of it with CSS. I then went on to added functionality on the page using Javascript and EJS tags.
